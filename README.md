It has been a pleasant surprise to see how easy and fun it is to create applications using React Hooks and functional components. As you can see in the dashboard there are widgets showing sales information, a chart with the active users per month, and two more widgets related with the new members and the latest transactions. 

When you click Users in the sidebar link you go to the users list. This is a very useful data grid. It is possible to select all or only some of them, sort them by clicking any title, delete and also edit the user details.

In the users page you can see the user information and update any of them and you can create new users as well.

It happens the same with the products. In case you select Products in the sidebar link you will get the products list as you can see in the following picture.

You can reach the sales analytics information.

It is important you know this is just an example design. It is not connected to any database.
